# NaN Key Error Fix Summary

## Problem
React console error: "Encountered two children with the same key, `NaN`. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates."

This error occurred when rendering lists of businesses and ads on the home page and other pages.

## Root Cause
The API responses were returning items with invalid or missing IDs, which when parsed resulted in `NaN` values. When multiple items had `NaN` as their ID, React detected duplicate keys and threw an error.

## Solution
Added ID validation filters to all data fetching operations to exclude items with invalid IDs before rendering.

## Implementation

### 1. Updated Business Type Definition
**File:** `web/lib/types.ts`

Added optional fields to Business interface:
```typescript
export interface Business {
  id: number
  name: string
  location?: string
  description?: string
  category?: string
  reputation?: number
  owner: number
  created_at: string
  media_files?: Media[]
}
```

### 2. Added ID Validation Filter
Applied to all pages that fetch and render lists:

```typescript
// Filter out items with invalid IDs
const items = (response.results || [])
  .filter((item) => item.id && !isNaN(item.id))
```

### 3. Files Modified

**Home Page:**
- `web/app/page.tsx` - Added filters for ads and businesses

**Normal User Mode:**
- `web/app/ads/page.tsx` - Added filters for ads and businesses
- `web/app/businesses/page.tsx` - Added filter for businesses

**Business Owner Mode:**
- `web/app/business/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added filters for ads and offers
- `web/app/business/ads/page.tsx` - Added filter for ads
- `web/app/business/offers/page.tsx` - Added filter for offers

**Advertiser Mode:**
- `web/app/advertiser/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added filters for applications and offers
- `web/app/advertiser/applications/page.tsx` - Added filter for applications
- `web/app/advertiser/offers/page.tsx` - Added filters for offers and ads

## Filter Pattern

```typescript
// Before
const items = (response.results || [])
setItems(items)

// After
const items = (response.results || [])
  .filter((item) => item.id && !isNaN(item.id))
setItems(items)
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents NaN Key Errors** - Filters out items with invalid IDs
2. **Graceful Degradation** - Invalid items are silently removed
3. **Consistent Behavior** - Applied uniformly across all pages
4. **Better Data Quality** - Ensures only valid items are rendered
5. **Improved User Experience** - No console errors or warnings

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Navigate to home page
3. Check for "NaN key" errors - should be none
4. Navigate to ads page
5. Navigate to businesses page
6. Navigate to business dashboard
7. Navigate to advertiser dashboard
8. All pages should render without key errors

## Fallback Behavior

If API returns invalid data:
1. Invalid items are filtered out
2. Valid items are displayed
3. Mock data fallback is used if API fails completely
4. User sees partial data rather than errors

## Future Improvements

1. Add server-side validation to ensure API always returns valid IDs
2. Add logging to track invalid IDs for debugging
3. Consider adding error boundary for better error handling
4. Add data validation schema (e.g., Zod) for type safety
