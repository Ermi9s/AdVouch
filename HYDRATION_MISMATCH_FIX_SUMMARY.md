# Hydration Mismatch Error Fix Summary

## Problem
React hydration mismatch error: "Hydration failed because the server rendered text didn't match the client."

This error occurred when components called `getUser()` at the top level (outside of useEffect), causing different content to be rendered on the server vs the client.

Error example:
```
className="min-h-screen bg-background theme-business"  // Client
className="min-h-screen bg-background "                 // Server
```

## Root Cause
When `getUser()` is called at the top level:
1. **Server-side rendering (SSR)**: `getUser()` returns `null` (no localStorage on server)
2. **Client-side rendering**: `getUser()` returns the actual user object (localStorage available)
3. This causes different HTML to be rendered, triggering hydration mismatch

## Solution
Move all `getUser()` calls into `useEffect` hooks so they only run on the client after hydration.

## Implementation

### Pattern Before (Causes Hydration Mismatch)
```typescript
export default function MyPage() {
  const user = getUser()  // ❌ Called at top level
  
  return (
    <div className={user?.mode === "business" ? "theme-business" : ""}>
      {user && <Link href="/business/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Pattern After (Correct)
```typescript
export default function MyPage() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<ReturnType<typeof getUser> | null>(null)
  
  useEffect(() => {
    setUser(getUser())  // ✅ Called in useEffect
  }, [])
  
  return (
    <div className={user?.mode === "business" ? "theme-business" : ""}>
      {user && <Link href="/business/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **web/app/ads/page.tsx**
   - Moved `getUser()` into useEffect
   - Created `user` state variable
   - Removed top-level `getUser()` call

2. **web/app/businesses/page.tsx**
   - Moved `getUser()` into useEffect
   - Created `user` state variable
   - Removed top-level `getUser()` call

3. **web/app/advertiser/dashboard/page.tsx**
   - Moved `getUser()` into useEffect
   - Created `user` state variable
   - Removed duplicate `getUser()` call at line 79

4. **web/app/business/dashboard/page.tsx**
   - Moved `getUser()` into useEffect
   - Created `user` state variable
   - Removed duplicate `getUser()` call

5. **web/app/businesses/[id]/page.tsx**
   - Moved `getUser()` into useEffect
   - Created `user` state variable
   - Added new useEffect for user initialization

## Key Changes

### State Declaration
```typescript
const [user, setUser] = useState<ReturnType<typeof getUser> | null>(null)
```

### useEffect Hook
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const currentUser = getUser()
  setUser(currentUser)
  setIsAuthenticated(!!currentUser)
}, [])
```

### Conditional Rendering
```typescript
// Now safe - user is null on server, populated on client
{user && user.mode === "business" && (
  <Link href="/business/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>
)}
```

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates Hydration Mismatch** - Server and client render identical HTML
2. **Proper SSR Support** - Component works correctly with Next.js SSR
3. **Type Safety** - TypeScript knows user can be null
4. **Consistent Behavior** - User state is properly managed
5. **Better Performance** - No unnecessary re-renders

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check for hydration mismatch warnings - should be none
3. Navigate to ads page
4. Navigate to businesses page
5. Navigate to business dashboard
6. Navigate to advertiser dashboard
7. Navigate to business detail page
8. All pages should render without hydration errors

## Server-Side Rendering Behavior

With these fixes:
- **Server**: Renders with `user = null` (no theme class, no user-specific links)
- **Client**: Hydrates and updates with actual user data
- **Result**: Smooth transition without hydration errors

## Related Pages Already Correct

The following pages were already correctly implemented:
- `web/app/page.tsx` - Already uses useEffect for getUser()
- `web/app/advertiser/applications/page.tsx` - Uses getUser() in useEffect for redirect
- `web/app/business/analytics/page.tsx` - Uses getUser() in useEffect for redirect
- `web/app/business/ads/page.tsx` - Already correct
- `web/app/business/offers/page.tsx` - Already correct
- `web/app/advertiser/offers/page.tsx` - Already correct

## Future Improvements

1. Create a custom hook `useCurrentUser()` to avoid repetition
2. Add error boundary for better error handling
3. Consider using React Context for global user state
4. Add loading state while user is being fetched
