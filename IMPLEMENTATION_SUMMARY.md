# AdVouch Frontend Implementation Summary

## ✅ All Requirements Implemented

### 1. **Unauthenticated User Access**
- ✅ Unauthenticated users can browse ads and businesses without signing in
- ✅ Normal user mode is the default for unauthenticated users
- ✅ All normal user features (search, filter, view details) are accessible without authentication

**Implementation:**
- Pages `/ads` and `/businesses` allow unauthenticated access
- No authentication checks block these pages
- API calls gracefully fall back to mock data if backend is unavailable

### 2. **Sign-In Banner**
- ✅ Sign-in banner appears at the top of pages for unauthenticated users
- ✅ Banner includes "Sign In" button linking to `/auth`
- ✅ Banner can be dismissed by clicking the X button
- ✅ Banner disappears after user authenticates

**Implementation:**
- New component: `web/components/signin-banner.tsx`
- Added to: `/app/page.tsx`, `/app/ads/page.tsx`, `/app/businesses/page.tsx`
- Uses `isAuthenticated` state to conditionally render
- Sticky positioning at top with z-index 40

### 3. **Mode Switcher - Authenticated Users Only**
- ✅ Mode switcher only appears for authenticated users
- ✅ Unauthenticated users do NOT see the mode switcher
- ✅ Mode switcher shows current mode and allows switching between modes
- ✅ Fixed ModeTransition error in GlobalModeSwitcher

**Implementation:**
- `GlobalModeSwitcher` checks `getUser()` and returns null if not authenticated
- Fixed onComplete callback in ModeTransition component
- Mode switcher positioned at top-right with z-index 50

### 4. **Profile Completion Banner**
- ✅ Banner appears in business owner dashboard when profile is incomplete
- ✅ Banner appears in advertiser dashboard when profile is incomplete
- ✅ Banner links to onboarding page (`/business/onboarding` or `/advertiser/onboarding`)
- ✅ Banner can be dismissed

**Implementation:**
- Component: `web/components/profile-completion-banner.tsx`
- Used in: `/app/business/dashboard/page.tsx`, `/app/advertiser/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Tracks profile completion status in localStorage
- Shows only when `isProfileComplete(mode)` returns false

### 5. **Normal User Features in All Modes**
- ✅ Business owner dashboard includes "Browse Ads" and "Browse Businesses" links
- ✅ Advertiser dashboard includes "Browse Ads" and "Browse Businesses" links
- ✅ All normal user functionality is accessible from other modes
- ✅ Users can switch between modes and access all features

**Implementation:**
- `DashboardHeader` component includes navigation links for all modes
- Links to `/ads` and `/businesses` available in both business and advertiser modes
- Mode-specific links also available (My Ads, Offers, Applications, etc.)

### 6. **Mode Isolation & Separation**
- ✅ Each mode acts as a separate site with independent state
- ✅ Modes do NOT interfere with each other
- ✅ Mode-specific navigation and UI
- ✅ Mode-specific theme classes (theme-business, theme-advertiser)
- ✅ Separate profile completion tracking for each mode
- ✅ Users must explicitly switch modes to change

**Implementation:**
- User mode stored in localStorage with profile completion status
- Each mode has separate dashboard and navigation
- Theme classes applied based on current mode
- Mode switching triggers page redirect and state update
- Profile completion tracked independently per mode

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

```
Unauthenticated User
    ↓
Browse Ads/Businesses (with Sign-In Banner)
    ↓
Click "Sign In" → /auth page
    ↓
Fayda OAuth Flow
    ↓
/auth/callback → Authenticate
    ↓
Authenticated User (Mode Switcher Appears)
    ↓
Redirect to mode-specific dashboard
    ↓
Can switch modes or browse normal user features
```

## 🎯 Mode Behavior

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Test complete user flows with real backend
2. Verify authentication with Fayda eSignet
3. Test mode switching and state persistence
4. Verify profile completion tracking
5. Test API integration for all modes
6. Performance optimization if needed
